# Instructions for Generating Table 8 in Our Revised Manuscript
## Table 8 - DN-PINNs Result
To acquire the data represented in the first row of Table 8, execute the script `DN-PINNs-2prob-5D.py`.

## Table 8 - DNLM(PINN) Result
For the results displayed in the Table 8, execute the script `DNLM-2prob-5D-Compensent.py` to generate the corresponding data.

## Table 8 - DNLM(Ritz) Result
For the data displayed in the Table 8, execute the script `DNLM-2prob-5D-Compensent-Ritz.py` to generate the corresponding results.

Owing to the challenges in visualizing high-dimensional problems, our presentation of results is exclusively through tabular formats in this situation.
