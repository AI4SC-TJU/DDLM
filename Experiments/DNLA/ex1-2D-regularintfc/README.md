# Instructions for Generating Figures 5-7 in Our Revised Manuscript
## Figure 5 (Fig5) - DN-PINNs Result
To obtain the data represented in Figure 5, execute the script `DN-PINNs-2prob-2D.py`.
 
## Figure 6 (Fig6) - DNLA (PINNs) Results
For the results displayed in Figure 6, execute the script `DNLM-2prob-2D-DNLM(PINN).py` to generate the corresponding data.

## Figure 7 (Fig7) - DNLA (Ritz) Results
To generate the results shown in Figure 7, run the script `DNLM-2prob-2D-DNLM(Ritz).py`.

## Figure Generation:
Utilize MATLAB and execute the script `plot_Solutions_1by1.m` to create the graphical representation associated with the data obtained from the previous steps.

Please ensure that all necessary dependencies and prerequisites for the Python scripts and MATLAB files are correctly installed and configured before executing the scripts.
