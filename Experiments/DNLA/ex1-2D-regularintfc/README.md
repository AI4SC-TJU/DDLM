#Instructions for Generating Figures 5-7 in Our Revised Manuscript
Figure 5 (Fig5) - DN-PINNs result
To retrieve the data displayed in Table 1 relevant to the FCNN and depicted in Figure 5, execute the script overfit-Dirichlet.py.

Figure 6 (Fig6) - DNLA (PINNs) Results
For the outcomes presented in Table 1 associated with the transformer network, execute the script Poisson.py to generate the data depicted in Figure 6.

Figure 7 (Fig7) - DNLA (Ritz) Results
To produce the results illustrated in Table 2, run the script overfit-Robin.py. Remember to set the parameter "alpha_left" to 1 for the first simulation and 1000 for the second simulation to generate data for Figure 7.

Figure Generation:
Utilize MATLAB and execute the script plot_Solution_1by1.m to generate the graphical representation associated with the data obtained from the previous steps.
Kindly ensure that all required dependencies and prerequisites for the Python scripts and MATLAB files are appropriately installed and configured before running the scripts.
