# Instructions for Generating Table 7 in Our Revised Manuscript
## Table 7 - DN-PINNs Result
To acquire the data represented in the first row of Table 7, execute the script 'DN-PINNs-2prob-2D-flower.py'.

## Table 7 - DNLM(PINN) Result
For the results displayed in the Table 7, execute the script 'DNLM-2prob-2D-Compensent-flower.py' to generate the corresponding data.

## Table 7 - DNLM(Ritz) Result
For the data displayed in the Table 7, execute the script 'DNLM-2prob-2D-Compensent-Ritz-flower.py' to generate the corresponding results.

## Figure Generation:
Utilize MATLAB and execute the script 'plot_Solutions_1by1_flower.m' to create the graphical representation associated with the data obtained from the previous steps.

In this investigation, Comsol was employed to construct the mesh within the flower-shaped domain for figure generation. The Comsol files, namely 'flower-quarter.mph' and 'flower-quarter-out.mph', were utilized. Possessing the Comsol software is crucial, and selecting "Comsol Multiphysics with MATLAB" is required to run MATLAB.
