# Instructions for Generating Table 7 in Our Revised Manuscript
## Table 7 DN-PINNs result
To obtain the data represented in the first row in Talbe 7, execute the script DNLM-2prob-2D-DN-PINNs-flower.py.

## Table 7 DNLM(PINN) result
For the results displayed in Figure 6, execute the script DNLM-2prob-2D-DNLM(PINN).py to generate the corresponding data.

## Talbe 7 DNLM(Ritz) result

## Figure Generation:
Utilize MATLAB and execute the script plot_Solutions_1by1_flower.m to create the graphical representation associated with the data obtained from the previous steps.

Please ensure that all necessary dependencies and prerequisites for the Python scripts and MATLAB files are correctly installed and configured before executing the scripts.
