# Instructions for Generating RRLA results in our manuscript
## RR-PINNs Result
To acquire the data represented in Figure 14 and Figure 15, execute the script `RR-PINNs-2Prob-2D.py`.

## RRLM(PINN) Result
For the results displayed in Figure 16, execute the script `RRLM-2prob-2D-Compensent.py` to generate the corresponding data.

## Figure Generation:
Utilize MATLAB and execute the script `plot_solution_1by1.m` to create the graphical representation associated with the data obtained from the previous steps.

Please ensure that the parameter "alpha_left" and "alpha_right" represent $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ respectively in our manuscript.
