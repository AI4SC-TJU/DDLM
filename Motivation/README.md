# Introduction
This is the code for the figures shown in Remark 2.1 and Remark 2.2
The exact solution is shown as follows
![fig-Dirichlet-overfit-Improved-PINN-e2w-u-exact-1](https://github.com/AI4SC-TJU/DDMLearning4Ellipticproblem/assets/93070782/80ad3b5a-cacf-4b9b-8d68-85f8adb30590)
## Table 1 - FCNN results
To obtain the results shown in Table 1 for the FCNN, execute the script Overfit-Dirichlet.py
## Table 1 - Transformer Network Results
For the results shown in Table 1 related to the transformer network, execute the script Poisson2D.py.
## Table 2 - results
To generate the results presented in Table 2, run the script Overfit-Robin.py. Additionally, set the parameter "alpha_left" to 1 for the first simulation and 1000 for the second simulation.
## Figure Generation:
Utilize MATLAB to execute the script plot_overfit_baseline.m in order to generate the figure associated with the data obtained from the previous steps.
